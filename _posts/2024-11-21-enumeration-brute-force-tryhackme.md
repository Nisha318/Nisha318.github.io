## Overview
This blog documents my walkthrough of the **Enumeration & Brute Force** room on TryHackMe. The room covers various techniques for enumeration, brute-forcing, and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each task and what I learned along the way.

## Task 6: OSINT
- No answer needed

---

## Task 7: Conclusion
This room provided hands-on experience in identifying and exploiting common vulnerabilities in web applications, such as authentication enumeration, weak password reset mechanisms, and insecure HTTP Basic Authentication. Understanding these techniques enhances my ability to better protect systems from such attacks.
