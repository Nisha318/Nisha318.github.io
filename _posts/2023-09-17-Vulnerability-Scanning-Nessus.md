Just dived into this powerful cybersecurity tool developed by Tenable, Inc. It's a go-to solution for vulnerability assessment and management.

Here's a peek at what I was able to accomplish:

<ul>

<li> I downloaded and installed Nessus as a tool on my Kali Linux VM and then I initiated Basic Scans against two other devices on my home network:</li>

<ul>

<li>
💻 <b>Hulk</b> - a Windows 10 VM that is being used as a Universal Forwarder for sending WinEvent logs to my Splunk server </li>

<li> 💻 <b>GNS3 Server VM </b>- a network simulator application that is running on a Linux Server VM
Download and Install NessusHere's what #Nessus can do:</li>

</ul>

💪 Benefits and Solutions:

<li>🔍 <b>Vulnerability Assessment: </b> It scans and assesses your systems, devices, and apps to pinpoint security weaknesses, known vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations. From servers to routers, it's got you covered. </li>

</li>✔ <b>Compliance Check:</b> Helps meet regulations like PCI DSS, HIPAA, and NIST by finding non-compliance vulnerabilities.</li>


</li>✳ <b>Risk Analysis:</b> Rates vulnerabilities by severity, so you can tackle the big problems first. </li>

<li><b>📈Asset Management:</b> Keeps your asset inventory current, making management and security easier.</li>

<li>👊🏽 <b>Action Time: </b> After scanning, prioritize, remediate, and monitor vulnerabilities.
