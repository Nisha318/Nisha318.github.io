### The Exciting World of Cybersecurity: 100 Days of Learning

<img src="/assets/images/T1 Badge.jpg">

I was extremely thrilled about getting accepted into Tier 1 of the Women in Cybersecurity (WiCyS) Security Training Scholarship recently. Tier 1 consists of the SANS BootUp Capture-the-flag (CTF) event created specifically for the WiCyS Security Training Scholarship. This event is designed to be a fun way to practice and learn cybersecurity skills. It involves challenges such as finding hidden code on a web page or identifying if communications are authentic. The event was browser-based and provided a “hint” feature in case we got stuck.

So it began this past weekend, I embarked on a thrilling adventure in the realm of cybersecurity by participating in this event and I couldn’t have anticipated the excitement and passion that would engulf me during and after my very first CTF event. Today, I am delighted to share my experiences and the commitment I’ve made to continue on a journey of learning Cybersecurity through a 100 Days of Cybersecurity Challenge!

<h4> The Thrill of My First CTF Event </h4>
Participating in my first CTF event was nothing short of exciting. The challenges were like puzzles that required a unique blend of creativity, problem-solving, and technical expertise to unlock. I was fortunate to earn my initial event badges, a token of my determination throughout this event. These badge are a reminder of the knowledge I’ve gained, the skills I’ve honed, and the opportunities that are available for me to explore and learn more!

<h4> Challenges That Fueled My Passion </h4>
During the CTF event, I encountered various types of challenges that pushed my boundaries and tested my skills. Here are a few examples:
<ol>
<li> <b>Crypto Conundrum:</b> Decrypting encrypted messages and uncovering hidden information was both challenging and satisfying. It taught me the importance of cryptographic techniques in cybersecurity. </li>

<li> <b> Web Vulnerability Hunt: </b> Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications was an eye-opener. These were the most difficult of the challenges that I encountered during the event. I have a lot of learning to do in this category. While I understood how to use scanning tools to look for open ports on these applications, I lacked understanding how to use the tools that I had available to exploit these vulnerabilities. </li>

<li> <b> Forensic Investigations: </b> Delving into digital forensics tasks, such as analyzing log files and examining system artifacts, taught me the value of digital evidence and incident response.</li>

<li> <b> Network Puzzles: </b> analyzing network traffic using wireshark packet captures, identifying anomalies, and securing network configurations were crucial skills I acquired. Network security is the backbone of cybersecurity. My Network Engineering background served me well in this category, as finding flags hidden within the pcaps were some of the easier challenges for me.</li>

<h4> A Daily Commitment to Learning </h4>
My experience in the CTF event fueled my desire to learn more about cybersecurity. To ensure that I continue growing, I’ve committed to learning at least one new tool or methodology every day. This daily habit will not only deepen my knowledge but also help me stay current in the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity.

<h4> Launching the 100 Days of Cybersecurity Challenge</h4>
To document my journey and share my progress with the cybersecurity community, I’ve initiated my own “100 Days of Cybersecurity Challenge.” Each day, I will explore a new concept, tool, or methodology related to cybersecurity and share my insights and experiences on social media. This challenge is not just about personal growth; it’s an opportunity to engage with and learn from fellow enthusiasts in the field.

My first CTF event with the SANs Women in Cybersecurity training scholarship was a turning point in my learning journey. It ignited a passion for cybersecurity that I hadn’t expected, and I’m determined to nurture it. With my CTF badge proudly displayed, I’m ready to tackle the “100 Days of Cybersecurity Challenge” head-on, driven by the knowledge that each day brings new opportunities to learn and grow in this dynamic field.

Join me on this exciting journey, and together, let’s make cybersecurity more accessible and inclusive for everyone. Together, we can strengthen our defenses and protect the digital world.

Are you ready for the challenge? Let’s embark on this journey of learning, discovery, and growth together! Let’s Go!!!!
