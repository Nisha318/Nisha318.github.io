> Walkthrough of the **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)** room on TryHackMe, part of the Jr. Web Penetration Tester learning path.

---

## ## Task 1: What is an IDOR?

**Q:** What does **IDOR** stand for?  
**A:** *Insecure Direct Object Reference*

IDOR occurs when an application exposes a reference to an internal object (e.g. file, user ID, invoice number) without checking that the user is authorized to access it.

---

## ## Task 2: An IDOR Example

In this task, we find an invoice URL in an email:

    https://onlinestore.thm/order/1234/invoice
    
<img src="https://github.com/Nisha318/Nisha318.github.io/blob/master/assets/images/thm/idor/idor-02.PNG">

Modifying the `1234` ID to `1000` revealed another user’s invoice.

**Flag:**  
    THM{IDOR-VULN-FOUND}

---

## ## Task 3: Finding IDORs in Encoded IDs

**Q:** What is a common type of encoding used by websites?  
**A:** base64

### Common technique:
- Look for =, ==, or suspicious long strings.
- Decode with:

    echo MTIzNA== | base64 -d

---

## ## Task 4: Finding IDORs in Hashed IDs

**Q:** What is a common algorithm used for hashing IDs?  
**A:** md5

### Example:

    GET /invoice?id=c4ca4238a0b923820dcc509a6f75849b

    echo -n "1" | md5sum

### Useful Tools:
- Burp Suite Repeater
- CyberChef
- CrackStation
- Linux CLI: md5sum

---

## ## Task 5: Finding IDORs in Unpredictable IDs

**Q:** What is the minimum number of accounts you need to create to check for IDORs?  
**A:** 2

Create two accounts and test access to resources created by one from the other.

---

## ## Task 6: Where Are IDORs Located?

IDORs can be found in the following locations:

### Common Locations Checklist

- [x] URL / Query Parameters – ?id=123
- [x] Form Data – user_id=123
- [x] HTTP Headers – X-User-ID: 123
- [x] Cookies – user_id=123
- [x] API Endpoints – /api/v1/customer?id=123

---

## ## Task 7: A Practical IDOR Example

The following API call returns user info:

    GET http://10.10.99.57/api/v1/customer?id=1

### Response:

    {
      "id": 1,
      "username": "adam84",
      "email": "adam-84@fakemail.thm"
    }

<img src="https://github.com/Nisha318/Nisha318.github.io/blob/master/assets/images/thm/idor/idor-04.PNG">


**Q:** What is the username for user id 1?  
**A:** adam84

---

## ## Task 7 (continued)

Testing another ID:

    GET http://10.10.99.57/api/v1/customer?id=3

### Response:

    {
      "id": 3,
      "username": "john911",
      "email": "j@fakemail.thm"
    }

**Q:** What is the email address for user id 3?  
**A:** j@fakemail.thm

## ## API-Based IDOR Testing Checklist

### Steps

1. Discover API endpoints using dev tools or proxy.
2. Modify predictable IDs (1, 2, 3...).
3. Check if access control is enforced.
4. Use Burp, Postman, or scripts.
5. Document unauthorized access and impacted data.

## ## Conclusion

This room reinforced several key lessons:
- Understanding and identifying IDOR vulnerabilities.
- Testing predictable and encoded identifiers.
- The importance of proper authorization checks on all sensitive endpoints.
