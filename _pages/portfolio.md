   text: "This project implements a critical **Risk Management Framework (RMF) security control** by deploying a **hybrid automation pipeline** (Config + SSM + Lambda). It provides **continuous, auditable enforcement** (CA-7) by automatically detecting and instantaneously **revoking** the severe security violation of unauthorized public access (0.0.0.0/0) to administrative ports (SSH/RDP), ensuring strict **Boundary Protection (SC-7)** and **Access Control (AC-4)**."
