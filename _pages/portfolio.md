    text: "This project implements a critical **Risk Management Framework (RMF)** control automation pipeline in AWS to maintain a strict security posture. Leveraging **AWS Config** for **continuous auditing (CA-7)**, it automatically detects and remediates severe configuration drift (specifically the unauthorized opening of SSH (22) or RDP (3389) ports to the public internet). This solution directly enforces **Access Control (AC)** and **System and Communications Protection (SC)** controls, minimizing public exposure and ensuring **continuous compliance** for high-risk assets."
