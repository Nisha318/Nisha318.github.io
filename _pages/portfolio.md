    title: "Use Terraform Modules to Build  an AWS Three-Tier VPC Network Architecture"
    text: "I built and deployed a scalable three-tier AWS network architecture using Terraform modules. This project included configuring a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with route tables, subnets, NAT gateways, and an internet gateway. I automated the provisioning of EC2 instances for application hosting within the tiers and integrated S3 for secure data storage. Additionally, I deployed Application Load Balancers to ensure high availability and used AWS Certificate Manager to manage SSL/TLS certificates. This project enhanced my understanding of cloud infrastructure automation and AWS networking best practices."
